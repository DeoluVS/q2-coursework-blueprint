# Memory Bank 

## About the Game 
This game was inspired by the Human Benchmark game where you have a sequence of squares appear on the screen and you have to follow the pattern in order to get points. The more you get correct the more points you acrue over time. This game is to test your memory and eventually it will test your cognitive functions, such as reaction time to gauge where you are at personally. This game is designed in a way where any age group could play it to work on their ability to retain information and replay it. Also, sometimes these memory test can be seen during the pre-screening phase of a graduate role in IT. They will use a series of games and test your ability to retain information and use it to progress through the game. However, for this instance, the memory game will be the main focus of this website. 

## Strategy
### Goals
- One of the goals for this project is to challenge the user's capability to remember the sequence.
- Create a game that has an increasing level of difficulty for each round the user passes.
- Create multiple levels that increase in dimensions of squares the user has to play.
- Create easy navigation for the user to move around the website.
- Create 3 levels ranging from a 2x2 grid to a 4x4 grid.
- Making the game difficulty at a manageable level, making it more accesible to more players.

### Research
From looking at other memory games, I had noticed a lot of different functionalities that seemed interesting. One of the more notable examples was Human Benchmark. One of the more interesting things that they had in their game was a way to build on their previous sequence and keep adding one more item to the sequence the user started with. They also added some audio cues to help the user remember which block to press.

The game starts with flashing one square and the game starts to create a longer sequence building off of the previous squares the user can remember. I like this idea but I will take my own spin on it by making each square a different colour and indicate a duplicate square in the series by placing a number on each square indicating that. Instead of having just one continuous level, I will have multiple levels with different grid matrixes from 2x2 to 4x4 with a cap on the increasing difficulty.
